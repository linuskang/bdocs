# V5

### v503

<Callout title="Latest Version">
  This is the latest stable version.
</Callout>

- Add ``DELETE /api/waypoints/id``
- Add ``license`` into each fetch request
- Add ``GET /api/users``
- Add  ``GET /api/users/id``
- Add bounding boxes to map, along with 3 new endpoints:
``GET /api/boundingboxes``
``POST /api/boundingboxes``
``DELETE /api/boundingboxes``
Along with these endpoints, we are introducing 5 functions in a new ``BoundingBoxes`` library:
```ts
BoundingBoxes.getAll(activeOnly: boolean = true)
BoundingBoxes.getById(id: number)
BoundingBoxes.create(data: BoundingBoxData)
BoundingBoxes.update(id: number, data: BoundingBoxUpdateData)
BoundingBoxes.delete(id: number)
```
For moderators, there is a new ``Bounding Boxes`` tab in the moderator panel for you to create, edit, and delete different zones. These edits are all logged to your discord webhook.
- Add the following new endpoints:
```
GET /api/openapi
GET /api/docs
```
- Implement full swagger UI documentation @ ``api/docs``
